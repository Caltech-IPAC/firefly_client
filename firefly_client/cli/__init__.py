# The following code leaves the the convention of using NumpyDoc long         #
# docstrings for the module and classes, and uses the NumpyDoc short          #
# docstrings. These docstrings are also referred to as PandaDoc docstrings.   #
# as they are used in the Pandas library.                                     #
#                                                                             #
# The departure from the convention is intentional, as `click` and `pydantic` #
# only support short docstrings for automatically parsing help text.          #
# Unfortinately, NumpyDoc short docstrings can only support either typing     #
# comments or help text, but not both.                                        #
