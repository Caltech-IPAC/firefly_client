# firefly_client

Python API for [Firefly](http://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly), IPAC's Advanced Astronomy Web UI Framework. This allows users to leverage Firefly in their Python notebooks for interactive exploration of astronomical data (images, catalogs, charts, regions, and more) with just a couple of lines of code.

Please report any issues or suggestions on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly_client/issues).
