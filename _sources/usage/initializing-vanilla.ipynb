    "[Firefly](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly), the interactive data visualization tool, is a web application (with a URL) that can be controlled from Python with a `FireflyClient` object. When we create the `FireflyClient` instance, we need to provide the URL of the Firefly server we want to connect to.\n",

    "By default, the value of the environment variable `FIREFLY_URL` will be used as the Firefly server URL. It can be set to one of the following:\n",
    "1. a local Firefly server which can be run via a [Firefly Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipac/firefly), typically at http://localhost:8080/firefly\n",
    "2. a public Firefly server such as:\n",
    "    - IRSA Viewer at https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer\n",
    "    - Rubin Science Platform Portal at https://data.lsst.cloud/portal/app/ (requires authentication; the `ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable must be set)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a bash/zsh shell, enter `export FIREFLY_URL=\"https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer\"` before launching the notebook via `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `FIREFLY_URL` is not defined, the default server URL is `http://localhost:8080/firefly`, which is often used for a Firefly server running locally.\n",
